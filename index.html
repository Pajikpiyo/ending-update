                <p class="content">My thoughts and prayer are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has
                    touched
                    the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live on in spirit, through the
                    lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my iPhone, iPod,
                    and
                    iPad off for one hour. May Steve rest in peace.</p>

                <p class="content">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I’ve written as an adult (and certainly
                    every one that has been published), almost every email I’ve ever written, has been written on
                    machines
                    created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC.
                    Steve
                    Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have
                    been
                    able to realize my own. You’ll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

                    forever
                    remember him. I’m still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles.
                    Heaven
                    has certainly gained an angel.</p>

                <p class="content">Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader and creator
                    in
                    the world. I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger
                    Apple. We
                    will remember him forever.</p>
